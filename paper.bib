Although RDF was proposed as a standard format for the web, these databases are still available in various formats. With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of bioinformatics knowledge integration. Bio2RDF is such a system, built from rdfizer programs written in JSP, the Sesame open source triplestore technology and an OWL ontology. With Bio2RDF, documents from public bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several of NCBI's databases can now be made available in RDF format through a unique URL in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The Bio2RDF project has successfully applied the semantic web technology to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of RDF documents linked together with normalized URIs and sharing a common ontology. Bio2RDF is based on a three-step approach to build mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson's disease. The Bio2RDF repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

	abstract     = {\{UML\} is the de-facto standard formalism for software design and analysis. To support the design of large-scale industrial applications, sophisticated \{CASE\} tools are available on the market, that provide a user-friendly environment for editing, storing, and accessing multiple \{UML\} diagrams. It would be highly desirable to equip such \{CASE\} tools with automated reasoning capabilities, such as those studied in Artificial Intelligence and, in particular, in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. Such capabilities would allow to automatically detect relevant formal properties of \{UML\} diagrams, such as inconsistencies or redundancies. With regard to this issue, we consider \{UML\} class diagrams, which are one of the most important components of UML, and we address the problem of reasoning on such diagrams. We resort to several results developed in the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, regarding Description Logics (DLs), a family of logics that admit decidable reasoning procedures. Our first contribution is to show that reasoning on \{UML\} class diagrams is EXPTIME-hard, even under restrictive assumptions; we prove this result by showing a polynomial reduction from reasoning in DLs. The second contribution consists in establishing EXPTIME-membership of reasoning on \{UML\} class diagrams, provided that the use of arbitrary \{OCL\} (first-order) constraints is disallowed. We get this result by using \{DLR\} ifd , a very expressive EXPTIME-decidable \{DL\} that has been developed to capture typical features of conceptual and object-oriented data models. The last contribution has a more practical flavor, and consists in a polynomial encoding of \{UML\} class diagrams in the \{DL\} \{ALCQI\} , which essentially is the most expressive \{DL\} supported by current state-of-the-art DL-based reasoning systems. Though less expressive than \{DLR\} ifd , the \{DL\} \{ALCQI\} preserves enough semantics to keep reasoning about \{UML\} class diagrams sound and complete. Exploiting such an encoding, one can use current DL-based reasoning systems as core reasoning engines for a next generation of \{CASE\} tools, that are equipped with reasoning capabilities on \{UML\} class diagrams.},

The lack of such insights hinders important data management tasks such as quality, privacy and coverage analysis. In this paper, we present LODStats, which provides a comprehensive picture of the current state of a significant part of the Data Web. LODStats integrates RDF datasets from data.gov, publicdata.eu and datahub.io data catalogs and at the time of writing lists over 9 000 RDF datasets. For each RDF dataset, LODStats collects comprehensive statistics and makes these available in adhering to the LDSO vocabulary. This analysis has been regularly published and enhanced over the past four years at the public platform lodstats.aksw.org. We give a comprehensive overview over the resulting dataset.},

	abstract     = {Linked Open Data (LOD) comprises of an unprecedented volume of structured data on the Web. However, these datasets are of varying quality ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowdsourced or extracted data of often relatively low quality. We present a methodology for test-driven quality assessment of Linked Data, which is inspired by test-driven software development. We argue, that vocabularies, ontologies and knowledge bases should be accompanied by a number of test cases, which help to ensure a basic level of quality. We present a methodology for assessing the quality of linked data resources, based on a formalization of bad smells and data quality problems. Our formalization employs SPARQL query templates, which are instantiated into concrete quality test case queries. Based on an extensive survey, we compile a comprehensive library of data quality test case patterns. We perform automatic test case instantiation based on schema constraints or semi-automatically enriched schemata and allow the user to generate specific test case instantiations that are applicable to a schema or dataset. We provide an extensive evaluation of five LOD datasets, manual test case instantiation for five schemas and automatic test case instantiations for all available schemata registered with LOV. One of the main advantages of our approach is that domain specific semantics can be encoded in the data quality test cases, thus being able to discover data quality problems beyond conventional quality heuristics.},

title = "A Calculus with partially dynamic records for typeful manipulation of json objects",
abstract = "This paper investigates language constructs for high-level and type-safe manipulation of JSON objects in a typed functional language. A major obstacle in representing JSON in a static type system is their heterogeneous nature: in most practical JSON APIs, a JSON array is a heterogeneous list consisting of, for example, objects having common fields and possibly some optional fields. This paper presents a typed calculus that reconciles static typing constraints and heterogeneous JSON arrays based on the idea of partially dynamic records originally proposed and sketched by Buneman and Ohori for complex database object manipulation. Partially dynamic records are dynamically typed records, but some parts of their structures are statically known. This feature enables us to represent JSON objects as typed data structures. The proposed calculus smoothly extends with ML-style pattern matching and record polymorphism. These results yield a typed functional language where the programmer can directly import JSON data as terms having static types, and can manipulate them with the full benefits of static polymorphic type-checking. The proposed calculus has been embodied in SML#, an extension of Standard ML with record polymorphism and other practically useful features. This paper also reports on the details of the implementation and demonstrates its feasibility through examples using actual Web APIs. The SML# version 3.1.0 compiler includes JSON support presented in this paper and is available from Tohoku University as open-source software under a BSD-style license.",

  abstract = {In the recent years JSON affirmed as a very popular dataformat for representing massive data collections. JSON datacollections are usually schemaless.  While this ensures sev-eral advantages, the absence of schema information has im-portant negative consequences:  the correctness of complexqueries  and  programs  cannot  be  statically  checked,  userscannot rely on schema information to quickly figure out thestructural properties that could speed up the formulation ofcorrect queries,  and many schema-based optimizations arenot possible.In  this  paper  we  deal  with  the  problem  of  inferring  aschema  from  massive  JSON  datasets.   We  first  identify  aJSON type language which is simple and, at the same time,expressive enough to capture irregularities and to give com-plete  structural  information  about  input  data.    We  thenpresent our main contribution, which is the design of a schemainference algorithm, its theoretical study, and its implemen-tation  based  on  Spark,  enabling  reasonable  schema  infer-ence time for massive collections.  Finally, we report aboutan experimental analysis showing the effectiveness of our ap-proach in terms of execution time, precision, and concisenessof inferred schemas, and scalability.},
